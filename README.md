# Android-Architecture
We present in Android-Architecture demo 3 types of Android architecture.

There are currently three major approaches to architecting your Android apps:
1.	Standard Android (Model-View-Controller)
2.	Clean Architecture (Model View Presenter) 
3.	Data-binding MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
